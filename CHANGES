
JasperStarter - Running JasperReports from command line
========================================================

Changes
--------

 1.0-SNAPSHOT
        JasperStarter now has commands: pr - process, lp - list printers.
        New command: cp - compile, can compile one file or all .jrxml in a
        directory.
        New input file types for command pr allowed:
          jrxml    - compiles implicit
          jrprint  - print, view or export previously filled reports.
        New output type: jrprint. This makes --keep obsolete.
        New parameter -w writes compiled file to imput dir if jrxml is
        processed.
        Parameter -t defaults to "none" and can therefore be omited if no
        database is needed.
        Input file is read once. No temporary files needed anymore.

 0.10.0 New report parameter types: double, image (see usage).
        New supported export formats: xls, xlsx, csv, ods, pptx, xhtml, xml.
        Windows setup available.

        part of the pdf name by default.

V 0.6.0 new options --printer-name --with-print-dialog --list-printers
